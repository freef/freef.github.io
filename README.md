## About Me
Matt Freeland is an artist and web developer currently residing in Boston.

I find that programming and art making are incredibly similar processes of building trying an idea, refining it, and improving it the next go round. I'm taken with novelty.
 love seeing ideas spring to life, working as a team.

 I have a background in publishing, manufacturing, art and web development. My curiosity and love of bringing new products into the world has taken me through manufacturing, travel, and publishing before development.

 I have a passion for bringing new ideas to life, greatly enjoys solving complex problems and the creative process.



Hi I'm Matt Freeland, artist & web developer. With my artwork I use abstract forms to explore and communicate my personal thoughts and feelings. As a web developer I love the process of refining code into efficient and engaging user experiences. In both my artistic and professional endeavors I strive to create works that are delightful, surprising, and accessible to all.


<!-- Hello! I’m a Software Engineer with a background in medicine, multimedia art, interaction design, and teaching. I love using logic, big systems thinking, and compassion to solve problems of all kinds, building things that are good for people.

While deepening my skills as a developer, I’ve also become fascinated by Product Management, supporting a diverse team in building the right things, finding the metaphors that help everyone get on the same page, and nurturing positive organization. -->

This project grew out of a series of studies where I was looking for a faster way to build up jagged and organic textures. Each one was made by pouring melted wax onto the surface of water and lowering a torn plastic bag containing a brick through the melted wax.
