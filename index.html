          <p>Hi! My name is Matt Freeland and I'm a software developer. For as long as I can remember I've loved the creative process.  I pursued an art degree to learn the tools and techniques for bringing my ideas into the world. Post graduation I worked in manufacturing but left to become more involved with product development and design. From there I joined a three person tour company and worked on the operations team for National Geographic Learning. In each role I learned  how products are created and gained experience into how business execute strategies. In early 2019, I left to pursue a career in software development. I find that the process of writing code is extremely similar to any other creative pursuit, full of unexpected challenges and puzzles to solve. I hope to channel my love for creative processes and my experience across all kinds of businesses to create software that delights people. </p>
